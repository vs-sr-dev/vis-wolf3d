/*
 * WolfVIS A.25 — Guard ammo drops (vanilla KillActor bo_clip2).
 *
 * Gameplay-balance feature: dying guards now drop a half-clip on their
 * tile, mirroring vanilla WL_STATE.C KillActor which calls
 * PlaceItemType(bo_clip2, tilex, tiley) for guardobj/officerobj/mutantobj.
 * Closes the ammo-economy loop the PoC was missing — without drops the
 * player ran dry mid-level (the user's "si finiscono spesso le munizioni"
 * complaint), whereas in real Wolf3D corpse clips keep the pistol fed.
 *
 * Vanilla amounts (WL_AGENT.C GetBonus): bo_clip = GiveAmmo(8) (the floor
 * ammo box, already modeled as PK_AMMO_CLIP since A.22), bo_clip2 =
 * GiveAmmo(4) (the smaller drop from a corpse). Both gate on ammo == 99.
 *
 * Implementation (minimal, reuses the A.22 pickup pipeline):
 *   - New PK_AMMO_GUARD kind = +4 ammo, gated at 99, GETAMMOSND chime.
 *   - SpawnGuardDrop(x_q88, y_q88) appends a fresh pickup Object at the
 *     guard's tile center, reusing PK_CLIP_SLOT (the floor-clip sprite,
 *     already loaded since A.22 — no new VSWAP load). enemy_dir = NONE so
 *     the AI ticker + painter sort treat it as a static decoration.
 *   - Hooked into DamageEnemy's lethal branch (the DIE transition), right
 *     after the death scream. No-op if the object table is full or the
 *     clip sprite never loaded.
 *   - CheckPickups already harvests any pickup_kind same-tile, so the
 *     grab path needs zero new code. Vanilla places the item on the
 *     corpse's own tile, so co-location with the dead-guard sprite is
 *     faithful (no free-spot search like DropItem — KillActor uses the
 *     direct PlaceItemType, which is the same tile).
 *
 * RestartLevel re-runs ScanObjects (g_num_objects reset to 0), so drops
 * from a previous life are wiped on respawn — no stale-clip accumulation.
 *
 * --- Original A.24 header (kept for traceability) ---
 *
 * WolfVIS A.24 — Per-frame flush narrowed to the dirty-rect columns.
 *
 * Pure framerate polish, zero gameplay/visual change. FlushFramebufToA000
 * (the A.21 RAM-framebuf -> A000:0000 blit) used to copy a full 320-byte
 * row for every dirty scanline, ignoring the horizontal extent of the
 * paint rect. In normal play the only dirty region is the 128-px-wide
 * viewport at x=96 (InvalidatePlayerView marks exactly that rect), so
 * ~60% of every viewport-row copy was wasted bandwidth (160 WORDs/row
 * moved when only 64 carried changed pixels).
 *
 * A.24 makes the flush honor ps.rcPaint.left/right as well as top/bottom:
 * _fmemcpy now spans only [dx0, dx0+dw) per row, with src/dst sharing the
 * same horizontal offset (only the vertical axis flips for the bottom-up
 * DIB convention). GDI hands us the exact dirty bounding box, so this is
 * always correct — a HUD partial re-blit widens the box back out on the
 * frames it occurs, and the boot full-screen flush passes the full width.
 *
 * Expected: viewport-frame flush drops from ~128 rows x 160 WORDs to
 * ~128 rows x 64 WORDs (~2.5x less copy on the dominant frame type).
 * No telemetry re-introduced — the dormant g_last_render_ms perf bar
 * stays unpainted so this win can be judged on its own (the bar's own
 * paint cost previously polluted such measurements; deferred by request).
 *
 * --- Original A.23 header (kept for traceability) ---
 *
 * WolfVIS A.23 — AdLib SFX (OPL3 ch0 SFX subsystem + 8 trigger points).
 *
 * Reciprocal-completion of the perceptual feedback gap diagnosed at A.20
 * ("CIPA": player saw HEALTH digit drop but had no audio cue).
 * Adds AdLib FM SFX playback on OPL3 ch0 driven by the canonical
 * 140-Hz frequency-byte stream from Wolf3D's AUDIOT.WL1, with 8 trigger
 * points covering the gameplay loop: pistol fire, enemy fire, halt
 * shout, enemy death scream, player damage, pickup ammo / health /
 * treasure.
 *
 * Vanilla source mapping (recon at S18 A.23 open):
 *   - ID_SD.H AdLibSound struct: 6B SoundCommon (longword length + word
 *     priority) + 16B Instrument + 1B block + length-bytes data stream.
 *   - ID_SD.C SDL_AlSetFXInst (line 1401): write 11 OPL registers via
 *     modifier op = reg 0, carrier op = reg 3, +alChar/Scale/Attack/Sus/
 *     Wave per op + alFeedCon (0xC0). All on OPL ch0.
 *   - ID_SD.C SDL_ALSoundService: per 1/140 sec tick, read next byte;
 *     if 0 -> alOut(0xB0, 0) (key off); else alOut(0xA0, byte) +
 *     alOut(0xB0, alBlock) (key on at frequency). Decrement length.
 *   - AUDIOWL1.H sound enum: 69 sounds. AdLib sounds at chunk 69+id.
 *
 * Trigger SFX (8 in scope):
 *   ATKPISTOLSND   chunk 93  : player fires pistol  (FireWeapon)
 *   NAZIFIRESND    chunk 127 : guard shoots back    (ShootPlayer T_Shoot)
 *   HALTSND        chunk 90  : guard sees player    (state -> SHOOT first time)
 *   DEATHSCREAM1   chunk 98  : guard dies           (DamageEnemy lethal)
 *   TAKEDAMAGESND  chunk 85  : player hit           (DamagePlayer)
 *   GETAMMOSND     chunk 100 : ammo pickup          (TryGiveBonus PK_AMMO_CLIP)
 *   HEALTH2SND     chunk 103 : health pickup        (PK_HEALTH_*)
 *   BONUS1SND      chunk 104 : treasure pickup      (PK_TREAS_*)
 *
 * Implementation:
 *   - LoadSfx(chunk_idx) reads chunk from AUDIOT.WL1 into sfx_buf[]
 *     (lazy-load, single SFX at a time; subsequent calls preempt).
 *   - WriteSfxInstrument writes 11 OPL registers per ID_SD.C
 *     SDL_AlSetFXInst (modifier=0, carrier=3, alFeedCon=0).
 *   - ServiceSfx: PIT-direct 140-Hz accumulator (mirror of ServiceMusic
 *     pattern from A.10; PIT_CYCLES_PER_SFX_TICK = 596400/140 = 4260).
 *   - PlaySfx(sound_id) dispatch: maps 8 trigger IDs to chunk indices.
 *   - Hook into PeekMessage idle loop alongside ServiceMusic. SFX uses
 *     ch0 only; music ch1..8 untouched (no register conflict).
 *
 * --- Original A.22 header (kept for traceability) ---
 *
 * WolfVIS A.22 — Pickups (medkit, clip, treasures, 1up).
 *
 * Reciprocal of A.20's damage loop: same-tile proximity grab restores
 * health / ammo or bumps score, with vanilla gates (hp==100 blocks
 * health items, ammo==99 blocks clips). Uses the existing decoration
 * sprite/spawn pipeline (Object slot, painter sort, DrawSpriteWorld)
 * with 8 new sprite slots and a small map plane1 obj-id branch.
 *
 * Mapping (vanilla statinfo[] WL_ACT1.C:22..114, GetBonus WL_AGENT.C:667):
 *   obj 47 -> SPR_STAT_24 chunk 26 (food)      PK_HEALTH_10  (+10 hp)
 *   obj 48 -> SPR_STAT_25 chunk 27 (medkit)    PK_HEALTH_25  (+25 hp)
 *   obj 49 -> SPR_STAT_26 chunk 28 (clip)      PK_AMMO_CLIP  (+8 ammo)
 *   obj 52 -> SPR_STAT_29 chunk 31 (cross)     PK_TREAS_100  (+100 score)
 *   obj 53 -> SPR_STAT_30 chunk 32 (chalice)   PK_TREAS_500  (+500)
 *   obj 54 -> SPR_STAT_31 chunk 33 (bible)     PK_TREAS_1K   (+1000)
 *   obj 55 -> SPR_STAT_32 chunk 34 (crown)     PK_TREAS_5K   (+5000)
 *   obj 56 -> SPR_STAT_33 chunk 35 (1up)       PK_HEALTH_FULL(+99 hp + 25 ammo)
 *
 * Sprite slots 70..77 carry the 8 pickup chunks (sparse, no rotation —
 * decorations have enemy_dir == OBJ_DIR_NONE so painter sort + draw
 * use sprite_idx as-is). Object struct gains a pickup_kind BYTE; on
 * grab, sprite_idx is set to -1 which DrawSpriteWorld already treats
 * as "skip" via its bounds check, and painter sort can short-circuit.
 *
 * Vanilla gates: medkit + food do nothing if hp == 100, clip does
 * nothing if ammo == 99. The pickup stays on the floor for a later
 * grab. Vanilla also ungates the 1up (always grabbed) and treasures
 * (no cap on score). We mirror this exactly.
 *
 * NOT in scope (defer):
 *   - bo_alpo (+4 hp dog food, gated == 100): same as bo_food but
 *     barely useful, not visible on E1L1.
 *   - bo_gibs (+1 hp, gated < 10): emergency heal, not visible on L1.
 *   - bo_machinegun / bo_chaingun: weapon upgrades require A.17 weapon
 *     class state expansion. Defer to a later milestone.
 *   - bo_key1 / bo_key2: door unlock requires the locked-door variant
 *     pattern. L1 has no locked doors so safe to skip.
 *   - bo_spear (Spear of Destiny): SOD-specific, WL1 shareware doesn't
 *     have it.
 *   - GiveExtraMan / treasurecount / EXTRAPOINTS lives bonus: lives
 *     system not modeled in PoC. 1up gives hp + ammo only.
 *
 * --- Original A.20.1 header (kept for traceability) ---
 *
 * WolfVIS A.20.1 — Combat fairness + damage flash polish.
 *
 * Two targeted tweaks on top of A.20 after first-test verdict
 * "structure perfect, feel punitive (CIPA — no sensory feedback)
 * + suspicion of shoot-through-walls". Two diagnoses tested in this
 * iter; wall-shoot deferred pending re-test post-polish.
 *
 * What changes vs A.20:
 *   - ShootPlayer hitchance switches to the vanilla "visible" branch
 *     (160 - dist*16) instead of the "not visible" branch (256 - dist*8).
 *     Reasoning: when LOSCheck passes, the enemy can see the player AND
 *     the player can see the enemy (LOS is symmetric on a tile grid).
 *     That's exactly the vanilla FL_VISABLE case where the player has
 *     a chance to dodge — vanilla halves the hitchance accordingly.
 *     Net at dist=2: 240 (94%) -> 128 (50%). At dist=4: 224 (87%) ->
 *     96 (38%). At dist=6: 208 (81%) -> 64 (25%). Combat becomes
 *     dodgeable instead of point-blank deterministic.
 *   - Damage flash. New g_damage_flash_ticks counter (set to 3 on hit
 *     in DamagePlayer) drives a red border drawn around the viewport
 *     rect after DrawCrosshair. Decremented per InvalidatePlayerView,
 *     painted only while > 1 (so the final tick is a clear frame —
 *     guarantees the red is wiped even if the player is idle when the
 *     count hits 0). WM_TIMER forces moved=TRUE while the counter is
 *     > 0 so the flash + clear frames render even without input.
 *     Border (5 px wide, color 40 = HUD_FG_LOW red) leaves the central
 *     viewport unobstructed — player still sees enemies during the
 *     flash, but knows they took damage at viewport-edge focal vision.
 *
 * Defer: wall-shoot suspicion needs more user data. LOSCheck is tile-
 * grid Bresenham (A.16b memo); sub-tile precision upgrade is a separate
 * iter (A.20.2 if confirmed) since it touches a hot path.
 *
 * --- Original A.20 header (kept for traceability) ---
 *
 * WolfVIS A.20 — Enemy fire-back + player health (gameplay loop closure).
 *
 * Closes the symmetric combat loop: guards now shoot the player back, hit
 * rolls scaled by tile distance, damage chips a 0..100 HP pool tracked in
 * the HUD HEALTH panel that A.21 had pre-baked. On death the player freezes
 * + HEALTH=000 in red; tapping PRIMARY restarts the level (reset hp/ammo/
 * score/kills + respawn at map plane1 marker + reset all enemy state).
 *
 * Mirror of A.18 (player -> enemy hitscan): every piece reuses an existing
 * pattern, no new render or input subsystem. The whole milestone is in
 * AdvanceEnemies (shoot trigger + SHOOT state ticker) + ShootPlayer +
 * DamagePlayer + RedrawHUDHealth + RestartLevel + a sprite-picker branch
 * + a WM_KEYDOWN branch. ~210 LOC delta.
 *
 * Vanilla source mapping (recon at S18 open):
 *   - WL_ACT2.C s_grdshoot1..3   : 3-frame anim @ 20 tics/phase, T_Shoot
 *     fires on phase 1 (s_grdshoot2.action). After phase 2 returns to
 *     s_grdchase1.
 *   - WL_ACT2.C T_Chase shoot trigger (line 3079..3140) : CheckLine LOS
 *     + chance roll. dist == 0 or (dist==1 && distance<0x4000) -> chance
 *     = 300 (always); else chance = (tics<<4)/dist. We translate tics to
 *     elapsed_ms / 14 (vanilla 70-Hz tic rate equivalent).
 *   - WL_ACT2.C T_Shoot (line 3444) : hitchance = 256 - dist*8 (player
 *     not running, not visible). Damage table tiered by dist:
 *       dist < 2 -> US_RndT()>>2 (0..63)
 *       dist < 4 -> US_RndT()>>3 (0..31)
 *       else     -> US_RndT()>>4 (0..15)
 *   - WL_AGENT.C TakeDamage (line 386) : subtract, clamp 0, ex_died on
 *     reaching 0. HealSelf caps at 100.
 *   - WL_AGENT.C DrawHealth : LatchNumber(21,16,3,health). HUD panel
 *     pre-baked at x=193 in A.21, 3 digits, init 100.
 *
 * What changes vs A.21 (single-pass additive edits):
 *   - NUM_SPRITES 67 -> 70. New slots GRD_SHOOT1..3 hardcoded at VSWAP
 *     chunks 96/97/98 (sequential after PAIN/DIE/DEAD at 90..95, vanilla
 *     WL_DEF.H:208).
 *   - New OBJ state OBJ_ST_SHOOT = 4. Phase 0..2 at GUARD_SHOOT_PHASE_MS
 *     (286 ms = 20 tics @ 70Hz). On phase 1 -> ShootPlayer(idx). After
 *     phase 2 -> revert to OBJ_ST_WALK.
 *   - AdvanceEnemies: live STAND/WALK guards roll a shoot chance every
 *     tick using the vanilla T_Chase formula. SHOOT state has its own
 *     phase ticker. Movement is suppressed during SHOOT.
 *   - ShootPlayer(idx, hWnd): mirror of FireHitscan but reverse direction.
 *     Tile-grid distance = max(|dx|,|dy|), hitchance = 256-dist*8 (PoC
 *     skips visibility distinction since we don't track FL_VISABLE).
 *     Damage roll matches vanilla tiered table.
 *   - DamagePlayer(dmg, hWnd): subtract from g_player_hp, clamp 0, set
 *     g_player_dead, RedrawHUDHealth.
 *   - RedrawHUDHealth(hWnd): clone of RedrawHUDAmmo at HUD_HEALTH_X=193.
 *     HUD_FG_LOW (red) when hp < 25.
 *   - DrawAllSprites SHOOT branch: slot = GRD_SHOOT1_SLOT + state_phase,
 *     non-rotating (vanilla statetype.rotate=false on s_grdshoot*).
 *   - WM_KEYDOWN PRIMARY: when g_player_dead -> RestartLevel(hWnd) which
 *     resets all gameplay state + invalidates the viewport. Else fire as
 *     before.
 *   - WinMain class name "WolfVISa23" + window title to match.
 *
 * Foundation invariants (do NOT regress from A.21):
 *   - DispDib BEGIN/END video-mode framing + direct A000 blit unchanged.
 *   - All A.18..A.21 weapon/AI/sprite/door/HUD subsystems untouched
 *     except the AdvanceEnemies extension and the small DrawAllSprites
 *     branch addition.
 *   - Recon-first 13-for-13 streak — A.20 is single-iter target.
 *
 * --- Original A.21 header (kept for traceability) ---
 *
 * WolfVIS A.21 — direct A000 framebuffer + DispDib BEGIN/END (PF finale).
 *
 * Replaces the per-frame StretchDIBits + Select/RealizePalette path with a
 * one-time DispDib BEGIN at startup, direct _fmemcpy to the A000:0000
 * selector each frame, and DispDib END at WM_QUIT. Per-frame GDI cost is
 * gone. Preserves bottom-up DIB convention by walking src bottom-up while
 * dest goes top-down inside FlushFramebufToA000. The selector idiom
 * (low WORD of &_A000H far ptr) is the offset-of-symbol patched by the
 * Win16 loader at boot — see reference_a000h_idiom.md for why.
 *
 * --- Original A.19.2 header (kept for traceability) ---
 *
 * WolfVIS A.19.2 — micro-perf bundle (PF finale step 3).
 *
 * Two micro-wins on top of A.19.1, both targeting the inner hot paths
 * where A.19/A.19.1 left residual cycles. Single-iter zero-fix track
 * record continues; both patterns are mechanical refactors of code
 * that already runs correctly.
 *
 * What changes vs A.19.1 (additive, two functions touched):
 *   - DrawWallStripCol ceiling/wall/floor fills do WORD pair-writes.
 *     Replaces `*fb1 = c; *fb2 = c;` (two byte stores, ~6 cyc/pair on
 *     286) with `*((WORD __far *)fb1) = pair;` (single aligned word
 *     store, ~3 cyc/pair). VIEW_X0=96 + half-col cast step=2 keep sx
 *     even, so all paired writes are word-aligned. CEIL_PAIR /
 *     FLOOR_PAIR / wall pair_w precomputed once per fill region.
 *     ~10 ms/frame across all visible columns at MAME-VIS rate.
 *   - DrawSpriteWorld outer column loop pre-clips dest_col bounds
 *     ONCE per sprite. Prior code iterated dest_col = dest_left ..
 *     dest_right (could be -200..312 for close sprites = 512 iter)
 *     and skipped off-viewport cols via per-iter `continue` after
 *     advancing srcx_acc. Now col_iter_start = max(dest_left, 0) and
 *     col_iter_end = min(dest_right, VIEW_W) are computed once;
 *     srcx_acc is seeded to (col_iter_start - dest_left) * step_q16
 *     so the first iter samples the same source column as the
 *     pre-clip code did. Inner loop loses the bound check entirely.
 *     ~3-4 ms/frame per close sprite.
 *
 * Foundation invariants (do NOT regress):
 *   - All A.19 / A.19.1 invariants (centered viewport, minimap toggle,
 *     Q.16 sprite scaler).
 *   - DrawWallStripCol Q.16 wall sampling (A.13.1) unchanged — the
 *     pair-write change is purely on the store side.
 *   - Z-buffer occlusion test unchanged.
 *   - Sprite post format unchanged.
 *
 * Defer to A.21+:
 *   - Top-down DIB orientation flip (recon: ~60 cyc/frame in setup
 *     alone, hot path uses fb +=/-= SCR_W either way — too invasive
 *     for marginal real perf, defer indefinitely).
 *   - Split telemetry (5 PIT-direct sub-counters for cast / wall /
 *     sprite / overlay / paint). Now meaningful post-A.19/.1/.2.
 *   - EnterDVA direct A000:0000 framebuffer (eliminates StretchDIBits
 *     entirely — programmers_ref.txt API recon already done in S15).
 *
 * --- Original A.19.1 header (kept for traceability) ---
 *
 * WolfVIS A.19.1 — sprite scaler accumulator (PF finale step 2).
 *
 * Closes the close-enemy freeze (H1) reported in A.19. DrawSpriteWorld
 * inner loop replaced its per-pixel long division with the Q.16 step
 * accumulator pattern already canonical in DrawWallStripCol — same
 * primitive, mirrored shape. When a guard is at near-clip distance
 * the projected sprite_h saturates at 4*VIEW_H = 512 px; the original
 * inner loop did `sy_src = (long)(dy - dy_top) * 64L / sprite_h` for
 * every pixel = ~80 visible cols * 512 px * ~250 cyc per pixel = ~10M
 * cyc per sprite per frame, perceived as a hard freeze (>1 s). The
 * accumulator pattern brings the per-pixel cost down to ~5-10 cyc
 * (one add + one shift + one bounded byte write).
 *
 * What changes vs A.19 (additive, single function rewritten):
 *   - DrawSpriteWorld inner loops use Q.16 fixed-point step:
 *       step_q16 = (64L << 16) / sprite_h    [once per sprite]
 *       srcx_acc = 0; advances by step_q16 per dest_col
 *       sy_acc   = step_q16 * (dy_iter_start - dy_top); per pixel +=
 *     Per-pixel cost: 1 shift to extract sy_src, 1 add for next sy_acc,
 *     1 byte store via decrementing far pointer (no per-pixel mul).
 *   - dy bounds clipped ONCE per post (dy_iter_start = max(dy_start,
 *     VIEW_Y0); dy_iter_end = min(dy_end, VIEW_Y0 + VIEW_H)) so the
 *     inner loop is bound-check-free.
 *   - framebuf access via decrementing __far pointer (matches the
 *     wallstrip pattern in DrawWallStripCol; bottom-up DIB so the
 *     pointer DECREMENTS by SCR_W per dy++).
 *   - sy_src clamping kept defensively: `if (sy >= endy_src) sy =
 *     endy_src - 1;` guards Q.16 rounding from sampling past the post
 *     end. Cost: 1 cmov-equivalent per pixel (~1-2 cyc on 286).
 *
 * Foundation invariants (do NOT regress):
 *   - All A.19 invariants (centered viewport, minimap toggle on F1).
 *   - DrawWallStripCol unchanged — it already uses the accumulator
 *     pattern. The cost asymmetry (walls fast, sprites slow) is the
 *     reason A.18+ guards "froze" instead of slowing — fixed here.
 *   - Z-buffer occlusion test unchanged (`g_zbuffer[dest_col] <=
 *     cam_y`).
 *   - Sprite post format unchanged: `t_compshape` triples (endy*2,
 *     corr_top, starty*2) terminated by endy*2 == 0.
 *   - HUD bake (A.15) untouched.
 *
 * Defer to A.19.2 / A.20+:
 *   - Top-down DIB orientation flip (eliminates fb_y inversion in
 *     remaining FB_Put callers — minimap mode + crosshair + HUD).
 *   - WORD ceiling/floor fills in DrawWallStripCol (paired byte
 *     writes -> 1 word write).
 *   - Split telemetry (5 PIT-direct sub-counters for cast / wall /
 *     sprite / overlay / paint).
 *   - EnterDVA direct A000:0000 framebuffer (eliminates StretchDIBits
 *     entirely — programmers_ref.txt API recon already done).
 *   - Enemy firing back + player health (was original A.19 scope).
 *
 * --- Original A.19 header (kept for traceability) ---
 *
 * WolfVIS A.19 — centered viewport + minimap toggle (PF finale step 1).
 *
 * Layout rework + first PF win. Removes the per-frame minimap cost
 * (DrawMinimapWithPlayer was 4096 FB_Put calls per frame, each with
 * 4 bound checks + a long multiplication for framebuf addressing —
 * estimated ~25-30 ms/frame on MAME-VIS). Centers the 128x128
 * raycaster viewport horizontally on the 320-wide screen so the
 * left/right margins are symmetric instead of viewport-on-the-left
 * + minimap-on-the-right. Adds a minimap toggle bound to VK_HC1_F1
 * (Xbox X / hand controller "third" button) so the minimap remains
 * available on demand without paying the per-frame cost.
 *
 * What changes vs A.15.1 (additive):
 *   - VIEW_X0 0 -> 96. Viewport now occupies x=96..223 (128 px) of
 *     SCR_W=320. Margins x=0..95 and x=224..319 in the viewport
 *     row band (y=35..162) are left at the ClearFrame boot color
 *     (black) — never overwritten per frame, zero cost. Crosshair
 *     and weapon overlay positions track VIEW_X0 automatically (both
 *     use VIEW_X0 + VIEW_W/2 etc., constants propagate).
 *   - g_show_minimap BOOL toggle, default FALSE. When TRUE, the
 *     viewport rect is repainted with a centered 1:1 64x64 minimap
 *     (same content as DrawMinimapWithPlayer in A.15.1: tiles +
 *     objects + door state + player dot + heading) instead of the
 *     raycaster pass.
 *   - Input rebind. VK_HC1_F1 (0x71, Xbox X button on MAME) toggles
 *     g_show_minimap. The A.10..A.15.1 music F1=Start/F3=Stop debug
 *     bindings are removed; the OPL/IMF subsystem itself stays in
 *     the binary (sqActive=FALSE means zero per-frame cost) for
 *     future re-enable. F3 is reserved for a strafe toggle in a
 *     follow-up milestone.
 *   - InvalidatePlayerView dispatch. Branches on g_show_minimap:
 *     minimap path -> DrawMinimapView(); raycaster path ->
 *     DrawViewport() + DrawCrosshair(). Crosshair is suppressed in
 *     minimap mode (would overlap the map and distract).
 *   - DrawMinimapView(): fills the 128x128 viewport rect with HUD_BG
 *     (dark grey), then draws the 64x64 minimap centered (origin at
 *     x=VIEW_X0+32, y=VIEW_Y0+32) using the same tile/object/door
 *     palette as DrawMinimapWithPlayer plus player dot + heading
 *     line. Sprite-style cell at 1:1 = readable on 320-wide TV.
 *   - Dirty rect in InvalidatePlayerView reduced to viewport-only
 *     (was VIEW_X0..MINIMAP_X0+MAP_W to cover the right-side mini-
 *     map; now MINIMAP_X0/MAP_W are unused in the per-frame path).
 *
 * Foundation invariants (do NOT regress):
 *   - All A.15.1 / A.18 / A.16b / A.13.1 invariants (renderer + AI +
 *     HUD + raycaster).
 *   - HUD bake (A.15) untouched — the y=163..199 row band is below
 *     the viewport rect and never overwritten per frame.
 *   - DDA cardinal-angle nudge (A.15.1 fix) preserved.
 *   - gamepal.h LOOKUP MANDATORY for any new color choice.
 *
 * Defer to A.19.x / A.20+:
 *   - Strafe toggle on F3 (movement quality polish).
 *   - DispDib / EnterDVA bypass of GDI StretchDIBits — programmer's
 *     ref doc has the API; future milestone for direct A000:0000
 *     framebuffer access (potential 30-50% speedup).
 *   - Split telemetry (per-subsystem ms PIT counter).
 *   - Sprite scaler accumulator (per-pixel division -> step add).
 *   - Top-down DIB orientation flip (eliminates fb_y inversion).
 *   - Enemy firing back + player health (was original A.19 scope,

 *
 * --- Original A.15.1 header (kept for traceability) ---
 *
 * WolfVIS A.15.1 — real BJ Blazkowicz face on HUD via VGAGRAPH
 * chunked Huffman. Replaces the A.15 primitive helmet placeholder
 * with the canonical SPR_GRD_FACE1APIC (full-health, looking
 * straight) loaded from VGAGRAPH.WL1. FACE1APIC = chunk 121 on the
 * shipped WL1 pictable (NOT 113 as GFXV_WL1.H enum says — the
 * shipped asset was rebuilt with extra interstitial pics).
 * Bundled cardinal-angle DDA nudge fix in DrawViewport cast loop
 * (centers ra by 1 unit when it would land exactly on a cardinal
 * axis — eliminates the spurious 1-px wall column at viewport
 * center on E/N/W/S exact heading).
 *
 * --- Original A.18 header (kept for traceability) ---
 *
 * WolfVIS A.18 — firing + hitscan + damage (gameplay loop closure).
 *
 * Closes the "horror stare" gap from A.16b: PRIMARY now fires the
 * pistol, hitscan ray finds the closest visible enemy in front of
 * the crosshair, damage drops hp, dying guards play the 3-frame DIE
 * animation and freeze on DEAD. Score and ammo on the HUD update on
 * fire and on kill via partial-rect re-blit (the static-bg HUD bake
 * from A.15 is not invalidated; only the digit boxes are repainted
 * in-place).
 *
 * What changes vs A.17 (additive):
 *   - Sprite slot extension. NUM_SPRITES 59 -> 67. New runtime-patched
 *     slots 59..62 = SPR_PISTOLATK1..4 (chunks total - 14..-11, same
 *     end-of-VSWAP discovery pattern as A.17). New compile-time
 *     entries 63..65 = SPR_GRD_DIE_1..DIE_3 (absolute enum 91..93)
 *     and 66 = SPR_GRD_DEAD (enum 95). Pain frames skipped per PoC
 *     scope (vanilla pain is a one-frame flash that flips back to
 *     chase; not load-bearing for the gameplay loop).
 *   - Input rebind. PRIMARY (VK_HC1_PRIMARY) now triggers FireWeapon();
 *     SECONDARY (VK_HC1_SECONDARY) takes over door-toggle duty (the
 *     A.14.1 OPL sanity click on SECONDARY is dropped). Movement keys
 *     and music keys unchanged.
 *   - Weapon FSM. Three states: READY (idle, draws SPR_PISTOLREADY),
 *     FIRING (cycles ATK1..ATK4 every WEAPON_PHASE_MS=100 ms then
 *     auto-returns to READY). FireWeapon() gates on weapon_state ==
 *     READY && g_ammo > 0; on accept it decrements ammo, advances to
 *     FIRING phase 0, and triggers FireHitscan(). AdvanceWeapon() in
 *     WM_TIMER does the time-scaled phase progression.
 *   - Hitscan. FireHitscan() walks g_objects[], projects each living
 *     enemy into camera space (same math as DrawSpriteWorld:
 *     cam_y = rx*cos+ry*sin, cam_x = -rx*sin+ry*cos, both Q8.8) and
 *     tests whether VIEW_W/2 (the crosshair column) falls inside the
 *     sprite's projected screen span [screen_x - sprite_h/2, +/2].
 *     Walls block bullets via the existing g_zbuffer[VIEW_W/2] which
 *     CastRay populates each frame; no separate ray cast needed for
 *     hitscan. Closest passing enemy is the hit; ties broken by
 *     smallest cam_y_q88.
 *   - Damage + state transitions. Object grows BYTE hp (init 25 for
 *     guards = vanilla GUARD_HP). Damage roll = 5 + (g_step_q88 PRNG
 *     >> 13) & 7 = 5..12, close to vanilla US_RndT()&7 + BASEDAMAGE.
 *     hp <= 0 -> state OBJ_ST_DIE, phase 0, tick_last = now. The DIE
 *     state plays 3 frames (DIE_1, DIE_2, DIE_3) at ENEMY_PHASE_MS
 *     each, then transitions to OBJ_ST_DEAD frozen on SPR_GRD_DEAD.
 *     PAIN flash skipped per PoC. AdvanceEnemies extended to drive
 *     the DIE phase timer; LOSCheck and chase logic skip dead/dying
 *     enemies (no LOS contribution, no movement). Painter sort still
 *     orders cadavers (corpses must z-sort with live sprites).
 *   - DrawAllSprites sprite picker. STAND/WALK paths unchanged;
 *     adds DIE -> slot 63+state_phase, DEAD -> slot 66. DIE/DEAD
 *     frames are non-rotating (vanilla statetype.rotate=false), so
 *     no atan2/dirangle math applies.
 *   - HUD partial re-blit. RedrawHUDAmmo()/RedrawHUDScore() clear the
 *     2-digit (ammo) / 6-digit (score) box with HUD_BG fill, draw the
 *     new value with DrawNumber, and InvalidateRect the small region.
 *     framebuf is patched in-place; static_bg is left alone (the bake
 *     was only used for first-paint; framebuf's HUD region is not
 *     overwritten by DrawViewport so values persist between fires).
 *   - Game state vars. g_weapon_state, g_weapon_phase, g_weapon_tick,
 *     g_ammo (init 8), g_score (init 0), g_kills (telemetry).
 *
 * Foundation invariants (do NOT regress):
 *   - All A.13.1: grid-line DDA, side-aware TileToWallTex, paired-col
 *     DrawWallStripCol, time-scaled AdvanceDoors, partial-src
 *     StretchDIBits, -ox -s build flags.
 *   - All A.16a: sparse sprite_chunk_offs, dirangle_q10, atan2_q10,
 *     ord_to_dirtype, painter sort over depth_q88.
 *   - All A.16b: x_q88/y_q88 as authoritative position, time-scaled
 *     AdvanceEnemies, per-axis collision, state machine in Object.
 *   - All A.17: mutable sprite_chunk_offs, runtime patch in LoadVSwap,
 *     DrawSpriteFixed for HUD/overlay 1:1 blits.
 *
 * Defer to A.19+:
 *   - Vanilla pain flash (one-frame interrupt of chase on damage).
 *   - Enemy firing back (SPR_GRD_SHOOT1..3 chunks 96..98 + RNG-gated
 *     T_Chase shoot branch + player damage).
 *   - SFX on fire (OPL3 chunks in VSWAP post sprite range).
 *   - Pickups (ammo/score/health drops on guard death).
 *   - Weapon switch (knife/pistol/MG/chaingun frame sets).
 *   - Real BJ face from VGAGRAPH (A.15.1 from S13 reminder).
 *
 * --- Original A.17 header (kept for traceability) ---
 *
 * Visual milestone: real Wolf3D pistol sprite painted over the
 * bottom-center of the viewport every frame, foreground-on-top of
 * the raycaster scene + in-world sprites. Static (no firing animation,
 * no input rebind — those are A.18 scope).
 *
 * Two-iter session: iter-1 shipped a primitive FillRect silhouette
 * (~14 rects, fan-art tier) and proved the overlay layout; iter-2
 * (this) replaces it with the canonical SPR_PISTOLREADY chunk loaded
 * from VSWAP at boot.
 *
 * --- Original A.16b header (kept for traceability) ---
 *
 * First milestone where guards stop being billboards and start being
 *
 * First milestone where guards stop being billboards and start being
 * actors: phase-cycled walking sprites, LOS-aware chase, sub-tile
 * movement, collision against walls + doors. No firing yet (PRIMARY still
 * toggles doors per A.14.1; firing arrives in A.18 with hitscan/damage).
 *
 * What changes vs A.13.1 / A.16a (additive):
 *   - VSWAP loader extended to also load 32 walking-frame chunks at
 *     sprite_start_idx + 58..89. These are SPR_GRD_W1_1..SPR_GRD_W4_8
 *     in WOLFSRC/WL_DEF.H (4 phases x 8 directions). They live at slots
 *     26..57 in our sprites[] array, packed phase-major:
 *       slot 26..33 = W1 phase, 8 directions
 *       slot 34..41 = W2 phase, 8 directions
 *       slot 42..49 = W3 phase, 8 directions
 *       slot 50..57 = W4 phase, 8 directions
 *   - NUM_SPRITES bumped 26 -> 58. Memory: 58 * 4096 = 237 KB on __huge.
 *   - Object struct extended:
 *       BYTE  state            : 0=stand, 1=walk (room reserved 2..4 for
 *                                 future shoot/pain/die/dead in A.18+)
 *       BYTE  state_phase      : 0..3, walking phase index
 *       DWORD state_tick_last  : GetTickCount of last phase advance
 *       fixed x_q88, y_q88     : sub-tile position in 1/256 tile units
 *                                 (replaces tile_x/tile_y for moving
 *                                 enemies; tile_x/tile_y stays as the
 *                                 spawn anchor for the painter sort fast
 *                                 path).
 *   - AdvanceEnemies(): time-scaled state ticker. Mirrors AdvanceDoors
 *     pattern from A.13.1 — uses GetTickCount delta so behavior is
 *     independent of frame rate.
 *       phase advance: 250 ms per phase -> ~1 s per W1->W4 cycle (close
 *         to vanilla path tic durations 20+5+15+20+5+15 / 70 Hz).
 *       movement velocity: ~0.5 tile/sec (close to Wolf3D guard
 *         speed=512/65536 tile/tic * 70 Hz).
 *   - LOSCheck(ex, ey, px, py): tilemap DDA from enemy to player, returns
 *     TRUE if no blocking wall hit. Mirrors WL_STATE.C:1037 CheckLine but
 *     simpler: walls only, doors treated as blocking for PoC (in vanilla
 *     they're transparent if open enough; we defer that to A.18 alongside
 *     hitscan, where the door-aperture math becomes load-bearing).
 *   - DrawAllSprites picks sprite by state:
 *       STAND: sprite_idx = 18 + sector              (existing A.16a path)
 *       WALK:  sprite_idx = 26 + state_phase*8 + sector
 *
 * AI behavior PoC (intentionally minimal):
 *   - All enemies start in STATE_STAND.
 *   - On each tick: if LOSCheck to player passes AND distance to player
 *     > 1.5 tile, switch to STATE_WALK and snap enemy_dir to the 8-way
 *     direction toward the player; advance position by velocity * dt
 *     along that direction. If movement collides with wall/door, abort
 *     and revert to STATE_STAND for this tick.
 *   - If LOS lost, revert to STATE_STAND (position frozen, phase reset).
 *   - No path/patrol behavior (vanilla T_Path is deferred — PoC has only
 *     T_Stand + T_Chase fused into one loop).
 *
 * Defer to A.18 / later:
 *   - Firing animation (SPR_GRD_SHOOT1..3 chunks 96..98), hitscan, damage.
 *   - Pain/Die/Dead frames (chunks 90..95).
 *   - Officer / SS / dog enemy classes.
 *   - Door-aware LOS (transparent when open).
 *   - Vanilla path/patrol behavior.
 *
 * Vanilla source recon backing the design:
 *   - WL_DEF.H:159-208     : sprite enum, GRD_S=50..57, GRD_W1..W4=58..89.
 *   - WL_DEF.H:602-609     : statetype struct (rotate, shapenum, tictime,
 *                            think, action, next).
 *   - WL_ACT2.C:418-444    : guard state defs s_grdstand / s_grdpath1..4 /
 *                            s_grdchase1..4 / s_grdshoot1..3.
 *   - WL_ACT2.C:3047       : T_Stand = SightPlayer only.
 *   - WL_ACT2.C:3069-3367  : T_Chase / T_Path movement + dir selection.
 *   - WL_STATE.C:1037-1185 : CheckLine LOS pattern (door-aware).
 *   - WL_STATE.C:1404-1478 : SightPlayer reaction-delay model.
 *
 * Inherited from A.16a unchanged: 8-direction rotation (atan2_q10 +
 * dirangle_q10), sparse VSWAP table extension pattern, painter's sort
 * over depth_q88, minimap red dot for guards.
 *
 * --- Original A.16a header (kept for traceability) ---
 *
 * First milestone where the world contains living-targets-in-waiting:
 * Wolf3D guards rendered as static billboards at their map_plane1 tile
 * positions in E1L1. Adds 8-direction rotation in iter 2 via atan2 LUT.
 *
 * --- Original A.15 header (kept for traceability) ---
 *
 * First milestone where the screen has chrome around the play area
 * instead of a black margin. Lifts the framing from "tech demo" to
 * "game" without changing the cast workload — HUD is a pixel-constant
 * blit baked into static_bg, so the per-frame DrawViewport pass is
 * untouched. Layout invariant kept: viewport 128x128, debug bar 30 px,
 * minimap 64x64, HUD now occupies y=163..199 (the previously-black
 * lower strip).
 *
 * Adds vs A.14.1:
 *   - digit_font[10][24] static const: 4x6 byte-per-pixel font for
 *     digits 0..9. ~240 B in code, no runtime heap.
 *   - DrawDigit / DrawNumber helpers (right-align with leading zeros).
 *   - face_placeholder: 24x24 stylized soldier-helmet drawn from
 *     primitives (FillRect) — no bitmap data needed. A.15.1 polish
 *     path: implement VGAGRAPH loader for the real BJ face frames
 *     (FACE1APIC etc., chunked Huffman in VGAGRAPH.WL1, separate
 *     from VSWAP).
 *   - DrawHUD: 5-panel chrome strip with LEVEL / SCORE / LIVES /
 *     FACE / HEALTH / AMMO / KEYS values dummied to constants for
 *     PoC. A.16+ enemies will introduce real damage/score/ammo
 *     dynamics; A.15 just establishes the chrome.
 *   - SetupStaticBg extended to bake HUD into static_bg (panel
 *     borders + dummy values + face placeholder all are constant).
 *     Net effect: A.15 adds zero per-frame cost vs A.14.1.
 *
 * Inherited from A.14.1 unchanged: door state machine, sliding slab
 * render, PRIMARY toggle, mid-plane interp cast logic, DOOR_TEX_IDX
 * sentinel, minimap door coloring.
 *
 * --- Original A.14.1 header (kept for traceability) ---
 *
 * Closes the cosmetic regression A.14 shipped with: the player visibly
 * walked through wall slabs at door tiles 90..101 because IsWall blocked
 * the cast (so they rendered as walls) while IsBlockingForMove let them
 * pass. A.14.1 makes doors first-class:
 *   - dedicated door texture (VSWAP chunk sprite_start_idx-8 = DOORWALL
 *     in vanilla Wolf3D) loaded into a 4 KB __far buffer.
 *   - per-tile state byte g_door_amt (0=closed, 64=fully open),
 *     advanced by WM_TIMER during opening/closing animation.
 *   - CastRay detects entry into a door tile, advances to the tile
 *     mid-plane (X=center for vertical doors, Y=center for horizontal),
 *     and treats the slab as a partial wall whose perp-axis extent is
 *     (1 - amt/64). A ray crossing the open portion passes through and
 *     keeps casting; a ray hitting the slab returns DOOR_TEX as tex_idx
 *     sentinel so DrawWallStripCol samples door_tex instead of walls[].
 *   - IsBlockingForMove returns true for doors with amt < 56 (mostly
 *     closed) so the player can walk through fully-open doors but
 *     bounces off closed/animating ones.
 *   - PRIMARY tap (VK_HC1_PRIMARY) scans the tile one step in front of
 *     the player along its heading; if it's a door tile, toggles its
 *     animation direction.
 *
 * Adds vs A.14:
 *   - door_tex[4096] __far (chunk sprite_start_idx-8).
 *   - g_door_amt[MAP_TILES] __far + g_door_dir[MAP_TILES] __far.
 *   - IsDoor helper (returns 1=vertical, 2=horizontal, 0=not door).
 *   - CastRay door branch + DrawWallStripCol DOOR_TEX path.
 *   - AdvanceDoors() called from WM_TIMER.
 *   - ToggleDoorInFront() called from VK_HC1_PRIMARY.
 *   - PRIMARY's old OPL click removed (door is the better use of the
 *     button; SECONDARY's click kept for now as audio sanity check).
 *
 * Layout 320x200:
 *   y=0..29       : debug bar (heartbeat + status, repainted on WM_TIMER)
 *   y=30..34      : black gutter
 *   y=35..162 x=0..127 : 3D viewport 128x128 (128 ray casts, ceil/wall/floor)
 *   y=35..98  x=140..203 : minimap 64x64 with player position + heading
 *   else          : black
 *
 * Controls (HC1 hand controller):
 *   d-pad UP/DOWN    : move forward / back along player heading
 *   d-pad LEFT/RIGHT : rotate counterclockwise / clockwise
 *   PRIMARY (A)      : OPL ch0 high click (legacy)
 *   SECONDARY (B)    : OPL ch0 mid click + key-off (legacy)
 *   F1               : OPL init + start music (idempotent)
 *   F3               : stop music
 *
 * Coordinate system:
 *   pos_x, pos_y in Q8.8 tile units. Map is 64x64 tiles, (0,0) is NW.
 *   Y+ is south (matches Wolf3D map storage). Angle 0 = east (+X), 256 =
 *   south (+Y), 512 = west, 768 = north. ANGLES=1024. sin_q15[a] = round
 *   (sin(2*pi*a/1024) * 32767), cos via shift by ANGLE_QUAD.
 *
 * Cast algorithm (PoC step-by-fraction):
 *   For each column, advance ray position by 1/16 tile per step. When the
 *   integer tile (tx,ty) changes and that tile is a wall, take it as the
 *   hit. Side X (vertical wall face) vs side Y (horizontal wall face) is
 *   detected by which axis crossed in this step. Returns Euclidean dist
 *   and tex_x (the 0..63 horizontal offset into the wall texture column).
 *   Fish-eye correction applied via per-column cos table.
 *
 * Cursor suppression (S8 fix for VIS native arrow showing through frames):
 *   1. WNDCLASS hCursor = NULL (no class default cursor).
 *   2. WM_SETCURSOR returns SetCursor(NULL); TRUE (suppress when entering).
 *   3. ShowCursor(FALSE) post-CreateWindow (decrement global counter).
 *
 * --- Inherited from A.12 (kept) ---
 *   Per-column post-walk pattern (the wall-strip is its texture-column twin).
 *   PIT-direct hi-res clock + skip-gap (A.10.1 polish).
 *   __far placement of large BSS to keep DGROUP under 64 KB.
 *   Channel-0 click separation from IMF ch1..8.

/* Cast a ray from g_px,g_py at angle ra using grid-line DDA (A.13.1).
 *
 * Each loop iteration steps the ray to the *next tile boundary* on the
 * axis with smaller side_dist, advancing exactly one tile per step. This
 * replaces the A.13/A.14 step-by-fraction (1/16 tile sub-step) DDA, which
 * paid ~16x in iteration count for an approximation that ALSO had texture
 * x errors at sub-pixel level. Grid-line DDA is both faster and exact.
 *
 * Fixed-point: distances are Q8.8 in tile units (one tile = 256). Player
 * pos g_px/g_py is Q8.8. Direction COS_Q15/SIN_Q15 is Q15 in [-32767..32767]
 * (one tile per ray-distance unit at full magnitude).
 *
 *   deltadist = 1/|d|  (distance ray travels per 1-tile step on that axis)
 *   side_dist = distance from origin to next grid line on that axis
 *
 * Returns perpendicular distance in Q8.8 (already partially fish-eye
 * corrected since it's a single-axis projection); out_tex_idx is the
 * WALL_COUNT index or DOOR_TEX_IDX; out_tex_x is 0..63.
 *
 * Door branch fires once per door-tile entry (vs every sub-step in old DDA)
 * and tests slab-plane crossing within the tile bounds, identical math.
